# Trung D. Nguyen

I am a computational scientist with expertise in molecular modeling, soft matter physics and high-performance computing.

I am particularly interested in understanding fascinating phenomena at atomic, molecular and nanometer scales aimed at designing new materials from bottom up.
To investigate these phenomena efficiently, I develop new algorithms, software tools and sampling methods to improve molecular simulation in terms of calculation speed and statistical quality.
