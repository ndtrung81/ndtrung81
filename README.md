This is the repo for my personal home page: https://ndtrung81.github.io/ndtrung81/

I am a computational scientist with expertise in molecular modeling, soft matter physics and high-performance computing.

In a nutshell, I am particularly interested in understanding fascinating phenomena at atomic, molecular and nanometer scales for bottom-up materials design. To investigate these phenomena efficiently, I develop algorithms, software tools and sampling methods to improve molecular simulation in terms of calculation speed and statistical quality.
