    <p>Hello! I am a computational scientist with expertise in molecular modeling, soft matter physics and high-performance computing.</p>
    
    <p>In a nutshell, my studies are devoted to two complementary topics. First, I am interested in explaining intriguing phenomena at atomic, molecular and nanometer scales in the area of soft materials design. Second, I develop tools and methods to improve molecular simulation both in calculation speed and statistical quality.</p>
    
    <p>My research ideas are inspired by the beauty of Nature, the symmetry of its structures and the irreversible, away-from-equilibrium nature of its dynamics. I found that many fascinating behaviors occurring at nano scales, if better understood, can be leveraged for engineering novel materials and devices.<p>

<p>You can reach me at ndactrung at gmail dot com, or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/trung-nguyen-6868b628"><b>LinkedIn</b></a>, for consulting with molecular modeling, scientific computing, GPU programming, or for potential collaboration opportunities.<p>

<p>You can also find my published research on <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=pFLOo-EAAAAJ&hl=en"><b>Google Scholar</b></a>. My public projects are available on <a href="https://github.com/ndtrung81"><b>GitHub</b></a>.<p>

<p>Highlights -- News</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>10/2025</b>: Development of Skyway 2.0, a tool to burst HPC workloads to commercial clouds, is in full swing: Support for AWS, GCP, Oracle Cloud and Azure are tested and functionalities expanded.</li>
  <li><b>9/2025</b>: Methods for reactive MD simulations are being developed for LAMMPS and tested in example all-atom simulations.</li>
  <li><b>8/2025</b>: I talked about my LAMMPS GPU optimization work at the LAMMPS User Workshop 2025 <a href="https://www.lammps.org/workshops/Aug25/talk/trung-nguyen/">(link)</a>.</li>
  <li><b>7/2025</b>: The PME Pathways to Molecular Engineering program concluded successfully with positive feedback from the students to my Computational module.</li>
  <li><b>7/2025</b>: I contributed to the KOKKOS package in LAMMPS by allowing users to tune the GPU performance via kernel parameters (PR <a href="https://github.com/lammps/lammps/pull/4573">4573</a>). The tuned performance is <b>1.2-1.6X</b> faster than using the default parameter set for most tested systems.</li>
  <li><b>1/2025</b>: GPU acceleration can make LAMMPS run <b>4X-40X</b> faster than CPU-only on the OLCF Frontier supercomputer with AMD GPUs. The more computationally intensive the molecular models, the more speedup the GPUs can offer:  Systems of dipolar particles benefit the most from GPU acceleration.</li>
  <li><b>11/2024</b>: I concluded my contribution to the UChicago Lighthouse project by optimizing LAMMPS GPU acceleration on the ALCF Polaris cluster. The simulation performance with NVIDIA A100 GPUs is <b>3X-16X</b> faster than the CPU-only runs on the full node with 32 cores depending on the nature of molecular systems, that is, how much computation is offloaded to the GPUs.
