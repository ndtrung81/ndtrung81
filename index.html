    <p>Hello! I am a computational scientist with expertise in molecular modeling, soft matter physics and high-performance computing.</p>
    
    <p>In a nutshell, my studies are devoted to two complementary topics. First, I am interested in explaining intriguing phenomena at atomic, molecular and nanometer scales in the area of soft materials design. Second, I develop tools and methods to improve molecular simulation both in calculation speed and statistical quality.</p>
    
    <p>My research ideas are inspired by the beauty of Nature, the symmetry of its structures and the irreversible, away-from-equilibrium nature of its dynamics. I found that many fascinating behaviors occurring at nano scales, if better understood, can be leveraged for engineering novel materials and devices.<p>

<p>You can reach me at ndactrung at gmail dot com, or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/trung-nguyen-6868b628"><b>LinkedIn</b></a>, for consulting with molecular modeling, scientific computing, GPU programming, or for potential collaboration opportunities.<p>

<p>You can also find my published research on <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=pFLOo-EAAAAJ&hl=en"><b>Google Scholar</b></a>. My public projects are available on <a href="https://github.com/ndtrung81"><b>GitHub</b></a>.<p>

<p>Highlights -- News</p>
<ul>
  <li>1/2025: GPU acceleration can make LAMMPS run <b>4X-40X</b> faster than CPU-only on the OLCF Frontier supercomputer with AMD GPUs. The more computationally intensive the molecular models, the more speedup the GPUs can offer:  Systems of dipolar particles benefit the most from GPU acceleration.</li>
  <li>11/2024: I concluded my contribution to the UChicago Lighthouse project by optimizing LAMMPS GPU acceleration on the ALCF Polaris cluster. The simulation performance with NVIDIA A100 GPUs is <b>3X-16X</b> faster than the CPU-only runs on the full node with 32 cores depending on the nature of molecular systems, that is, how much computation is offloaded to the GPUs.

  <li>7/2024: The PME Pathways in Molecular Engineering program concluded successfully. My computational module helped students explore the fascinating field of computational chemistry, molecular engineering and scientific computing!</li>
  <li>4/2024: I taught GPU programming at the ICTP School on Parallel Programming and Parallel Architecture for High Performance Computing in Kathmandu, Nepal.</li>
  <li>2/2024: GPU support for Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) and energy-conserving Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD) are now available in the GPU package in LAMMPS.</li>
  <li>9/2023: I gave an invited talk, titled "LAMMPS: A flexible tool for particle-based modeling at multiple length scales", at the CECAM workshop for soft matter simulations, showing outstanding LAMMPS features that benefit soft matter simulation studies.</li>
